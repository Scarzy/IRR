There are many systems where processing ability comes second to power usage.
Sensor, and energy harvesting systems fall well inside this category.
In the majority of lower power systems in use, such as mobile devices, power availability is large, however energy availability is limited - the system can draw a large amount of current from the battery at any time, however when the battery runs out of power the system fails.
In the systems focussed on in this report, energy availability is essentially infinite, however available current draw at any one time is minimal.
Due to these restrictions various technologies have to be utilised to maximise power usage and still provide reasonable processing capabilities.
