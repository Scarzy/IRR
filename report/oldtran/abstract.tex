In many logic systems the primary concern is not one of speed, but of power consumption.
In these systems calculations may be required at a very low frequency, the calculations are likely to be fairly simple in nature, and the available power is minimal.

In this paper, three different main types of low power logic are discussed; sub-threshold logic, adiabatic logic, and ultra-low-leakage logic.
Their various advantages and disadvantages discussed, and variations upon each are looked at.
