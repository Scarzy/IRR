As can be seen a variety of technologies are available for power reduction, with their various advantages and disadvantages.
For all the technologies, there are still losses involved, some of which can be remedied through the use of additional circuitry.
One possible form of circuit to achieve these additional savings is a charge recovery circuit, which returns charge back to the power rails.
