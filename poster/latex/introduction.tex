Many electronic applications require different system complexities and power usage.
There are two main forms of low power designs, one suited for batteries, one suited for energy harvesting.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Battery
	\begin{itemize}
		\item High power availability
		\item Limited energy
	\end{itemize}
	\item Energy Harvesting
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Low power availability
		\item Theoretically infinite energy
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
