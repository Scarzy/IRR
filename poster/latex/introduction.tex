Many electronic applications require different system complexities and power usage.
There are two main forms of low power designs, one suited for batteries, one suited for energy harvesting.
With batteries there is high power availability, but limited energy.
In energy harvesting situations there can be theorectically infinite energy, but low power availability.

Energy harvesting systems often require processing at minimal power expense.
They often run minimalistic tasks, designed to monitor the harvesting system.
Because their source of energy is the same source as is being harvested, the supply can be very small (possibly less than $2\mu W$).
As such, the logic has to operate with minimal draw, as otherwise it will run out of charge and fail, or it will negate the energy source.

There are two main forms of loss in logic circuits, leakage current and switching current.
In transistors a small but constant current flows between drain and source, this is the leakage current.
This current is required for correct operation, however it is often larger than it needs to be.
Switching current is caused by transistors switching, as they can momentarily all be turned on.
A large current can therefore flow from the supply straight to ground.
